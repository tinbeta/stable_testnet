# ESC Stable Testnet DApp

DApp that lets anyone connect with MetaMask on a testnet and:
- Deploy `SimpleNFT` (ERC721) and `EscbaseToken` (ERC20)
- Mint NFTs and mint ERC20 tokens (owner-only)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MetaMask installed in your browser
- Some test funds on Stable Testnet (claim from the faucet below)

## Install
```bash
# from repo root
npm run bootstrap
```

## Compile contracts and copy artifacts to the frontend
```bash
npm run compile
```
This compiles with Hardhat and copies `SimpleNFT.json` and `EscbaseToken.json` into `frontend/src/artifacts/`.

## Run the frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open the printed local URL in your browser.

## Using the DApp
1. In MetaMask, connect and switch to Stable Testnet when prompted.
2. Click "Connect MetaMask".
3. Deploy `SimpleNFT` and/or `EscbaseToken`.
   - For the token, enter the initial supply in whole tokens. It deploys with 18 decimals.
4. After deployment, copy the contract addresses shown.
5. Use the Mint section:
   - NFT: enter recipient and click Mint. Only the owner (deployer) can mint.
   - Token: enter recipient and amount (18 decimals). Only the owner (deployer) can mint.

## Project Structure
- `contracts/` Hardhat project (solc 0.8.20, OpenZeppelin 5)
- `frontend/` Vite + React + ethers v6

## Notes
- Frontend uses artifacts generated by Hardhat. Always run `npm run compile` after contract changes.
